# Deprecated

GitHub has added their own inline SVG rendering (https://github.com/blog/1902-svg-viewing-diffing), so this extension is no longer needed.

## GitHub Inline SVG

![preview](http://my.bruggie.com/image/0P3q312D0h36/Image%202014-07-22%20at%208.52.15%20PM.png)

Shows an inline preview of SVG files on GitHub. A Chrome extension.

### Install

The easiest way is to install here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-inline-svg/jbfbnojdibndlopjgadibhcphchdbfkh?hl=en&gl=CA

However, you can also use the `chrome` folder as an unpacked extension.

### TODO

* Make it not Chrome-only
